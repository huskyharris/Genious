In addition, the leather creates an incomparable look.The great variety of leather bags and handbags knows almost no limits. The big advantage of handbags is that almost any type of leather can be used. Whether cow, lamb or crocodile leather. In handbag production, the skin of countless animals can be used, allowing for different properties and characteristics to be chosen.Many handbags have additional patterns or motifs embossed. Leather can also be painted, perforated or decorated with stitching. Not only the surface of a handbag can be made of leather, the inner lining can also be made of leather. Goatskin, lambskin or pigskin are usually used for the inner lining.The following leather series from our range are suitable for handbag production: VaconaÂ®, Nature, Scandinavian, Siena, Flavours, Aspen, Montana, Granada, Dekofelle, Torro, Santiago, 'English' harness leather, belt leather, Opulence and Atlantis.The leather series we offer are of consistently high quality.

        text:"Fashionable shoes are made of different materials and are available in different colors and shapes.But what is the difference between shoes made of leather and shoes made of fabric? Leather has many properties that make it ideal for shoe production. Leather is malleable and can be sewn. In addition, impregnated leather is waterproof without sacrificing breathability. The robust properties of leather protect the shoes from dirt and injuries. Shoes made of fabric are also breathable, but the fabric is less waterproof and less protective against injuries. Due to the properties mentioned, leather is particularly well suited for shoes.Especially in Germany there are certain quality criteria for the quality of shoe leather. A particularly important feature is the rub fastness of the leather. Rub fastness is the resistance of the leather surface to abrasion. Another quality feature is the water vapor permeability and the tear propagation strength. The tear propagation force is the force that must be generated in order to enlarge existing cracks. The leather series we offer naturally meet these quality criteria.In the production of shoe bottoms, a so-called bottom leather is usually used. Bodenleder is mainly cowhide and is used for the production of soles, welts, welts and heels. The quality of the bottom leather used differs depending on the area of the skin from which the leather is obtained. As a rule, the leather from the neck area is used for shoe production. Croupon leather is only used for the outsole and the heel tip. Smooth leather, oiled leather or suede leather is used for the upper leather of the shoes. As already mentioned, cowhide leather is recommended for the sole.The leather series we offer are mineral-tanned or vegetable-tanned and available in different looks and feels. Choose from a wide range of different leather series. All series always have a high quality and condition. If you have any questions about our series or specifically about shoe leather, you can call us at any time. Our friendly and competent staff will be happy to help you."

        text:"A car only becomes a showpiece with its interior design. Car leather in particular helps to upgrade the interior in terms of quality and appearance. A high-quality leather interior transforms your car into an individual status symbol and also increases its resale value.The history of car and boat leather is as old as vehicles themselves. The first leather covers were vegetable tanned and impregnated with oils and fats. Over time, however, finished, pigmented smooth leather became famous. The advantage of the finished leather is that it is more resistant to dirt and other influences. Car leather and boot leather in particular have to meet higher quality criteria than other types of leather. Motor vehicles and boats in particular are constantly exposed to the sun's rays, so car and boat leather should have a certain lightfastness so that the leather does not fade. Open-pored leather in particular is highly susceptible to the effects of light or UV light. Therefore, a pigmented leather is recommended here. Car leather must also be cared for properly. In order not to damage the car leather, a mild cleaner should be used.We offer you the right leather to cover your motor vehicle or your seating and lying areas. Our leather has a unique feel and quality and impresses with an unmistakable look. The Siena Flavors and Granada series are particularly recommended. With a shiny, elegant and sporty look and a soft and elastic feel, the pigmented cowhide from the Siena and Flavors series is ideal for leather covers in cars or boats. Siena and Flavors have a thickness of 0.9 - 1.1 mm and can be ordered in 100 different colours. Granada is somewhat matt and, due to its thickness of 1.4 - 1.6 mm, has a coarser grain pattern. Siena, Flavors and Granada are also available in individual sizes. You will receive cuts measuring 60 x 60 cm or you will receive half or whole skins. Other series that are suitable for car or boat leather are Scandinavian and Montana or Granada.It doesn't matter whether you want to cover seat covers, steering wheels or fittings with leather. We offer the right leather for your needs.Do you still have questions about car leather or boot leather? No problem! We would be happy to advise you on the selection of the right leather series. Just give us a call or send us an email."
